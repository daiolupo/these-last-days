                <h2>When All Religions Unite</h2>
                  <h3>1. Unclean spirits came out of the mouths of what three apocalyptic figures? Revelation&nbsp;16:13</h3>

                    </details>
                <h3>2. The false prophet is identified as being the one that did what? Revelation&nbsp;19:20</h3>

                        <h4>That wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast</h4>
                        <p>Those activities are done by the second beast of Revelation 13, the United States of America (Compare with Revelation 13:14). When referred to as a “beast,” as in Chapter 13, the focus is on the political government of the nation. But when referred to as a “false prophet,” the focus is unmistakably on the religious element of the country. The primary religion in the United States is Protestantism.  Revelation 16:13 therefore describes the ecumenical uniting of three classes of religion: Paganism, Catholicism, and Protestantism.</p>
                        <p>Many Protestants do not realize or fear the steady, rapid progress of the papal power. Downplaying their differences, Protestant leaders have begun to court the favor of Rome, slowly playing themselves into the hand of the system their fathers gave their lives to resist.</p>

                        <h4>They are the spirits of devils</h4>
                        <p>Spiritualism is here depicted as one of the greatest deceptions in the last days. Spirits of devils, working miracles, may appear as ministers of righteousness, heavenly messengers, or as departed loved ones (See lesson 10). These miracles, performed by the power of demons, will be presented as proof of their divine origin. Our only safeguard against deception is a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>The belief that the dead are conscious, as held by nearly every Protestant denomination, lays the foundation of spiritualism, and is the first great error through which Satan unites the people under his deceptions. This, with the error of Sunday sacredness, unites the denominations and binds them with Rome.</p>

                        <p>We learned in <a href="lesson28.html#women" target="-blank">lesson 28</a> that a “woman” in symbolic prophecy represents a church or religious system. While a pure woman represents God’s true church, a whore is the most appropriate symbol for a corrupt religious system (Jeremiah 3:1-8, 20; Ezekiel 16:15-43; Jeremiah 13:27).</p>

                        <p>In Matthew 9:17 Jesus used the figure of wine to refer to teachings or doctrines. The “wine” of Revelation 17:2, being fermented, would indicate false or corrupt doctrines.</p>

                        <h4>Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication</h4>
                        <p>This text calls for a wider interpretation of the term “Babylon.” Because this angel announces Babylon’s fall, he must be referring to religion which was once pure and has now become corrupt. This Babylon cannot be Catholicism; for that system has not made any changes.</p>
                        <p>According to this verse, Babylon is identified by her “wine,” which is a product of her fornication with the world. That description would apply to any organization that teaches doctrines which are contrary to the word of God.</p>
                        <p>The word Babylon, derived from Babel, denotes confusion (Genesis 11:9). Does not this term describe the innumerable conflicting sects of Protestantism? This second angel is sent to declare the moral fall of all denominations which have departed from the pure doctrines of the word of God.</p>

                        <p>This angel declares that spiritualism has infiltrated modern churches. “For by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.” Revelation 18:23.</p>

              <h3>16. What three additional charges are laid against her? Revelation&nbsp;18:3</h3>

                        <summary>Answer</summary>
                        <h4>All nations have drunk the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies</h4>
                        <p>“The wine.” Among the false doctrines which all nations have drunk, the most serious is that of Sunday observance, which tramples upon God’s fourth commandment.</p>
                        <p>“The kings of the earth.” Protestants are becoming increasingly involved in government affairs. This relationship of religious groups with the kings of the earth is threatening the wall of separation which must exist between church and state. When this wall is removed, the results are fearful.</p>
                        <p>“The merchants of the earth.” The prophecy predicted that economic factors were to play a significant role in end-time religious political issues.</p>
                        <p>What a sad picture of modern religion. Although the Protestant reformers followed every ray of light they had, the organizations that bear their names have failed to advance into fuller light, and have fallen from the purity of the faith which they once held.</p>

                        <h4>Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues</h4>
                        <p>This is an unmistakable call for God’s people to separate themselves from those denominations which constitute Babylon. If we are members of a body which transgresses God’s law, we are partakers of her sins.</p>
