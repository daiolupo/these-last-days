                          <p>Colossian 1:16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him.</p>

                        <p>Psalm 8:5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.</p>
                        <h4>Angels</h4>

                        <h4>Cherubims</h4>
                        <p>Angels are not the spirits of dead people as some may suppose. No one had yet died when Adam and Eve were driven from Eden. The Bible speaks definitely of the existence of  intelligent beings in the universe before the earth was created (Job&nbsp;38:4,&nbsp;7).</p>
