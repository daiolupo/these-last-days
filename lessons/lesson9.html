                        <p>In 2 Corinthians 5:8 Paul speaks of “being absent from the body” and “present with the
                              Lord”. Does this mean that when a person dies, he leaves his body and goes to be with the Lord?
                              Let’s read the whole context to see what the apostle is saying.</p>
                        <p>In 2 Corinthians chapter 4 Paul discusses the trouble and affliction which come to us in this
                              life. Yet, he says, this trouble is nothing when compared to the “far more exceeding and eternal
                              weight of glory” (4:17) which we will receive in the future life. We don’t need to worry about what
                              happens to this body. We are now but “earthen vessels” (4:7). Yet the Lord will one day give us new
                              bodies which will never deteriorate.</p>
                        <p>In Chapter 5 Paul discusses the two bodies, the earthly, and the eternal. He metaphorically
                              refers to them as “houses”. “For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved,
                              we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens” (5:1).</p>
                        <p>Next, the apostle speaks of his longing to be clothed with the immortal body. “For in this we
                              groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven” (verse 2). To be
                              clothed here means to be living in a body. In this life we are clothed in a mortal body. In the next life
                              we will be clothed in an immortal body.</p>
                        <p>Now notice Paul’s emphasis in verse 3: “If so be that being clothed we shall not be found
                              naked.” If clothed means to be in a body, to be naked is to be without a body. Notice that Paul makes
                              it very clear that the future life is a clothed state and not a naked state! He gives absolutely no
                              support to the teaching of life without a body. Speaking of the future life, he says, “Being clothed
                              we shall not be found naked”</p>
                        <p>In verse 4 Paul re-emphasizes the same idea: “For we that are in this tabernacle do groan,
                              being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon.” It was not an unclothed,
                              bodiless state which Paul anticipated, but a clothed state in a body.</p>
                        <p>The next question is: When will we receive the immortal body? When will “mortality be
                              swallowed up of life” (verse 4)? To the Corinthians this was no question. Paul had already told them
                              in his first letter. He had devoted the whole of 1 Corinthians 15 to the subject of the resurrection.
                              There Paul had clearly told them when mortality is swallowed up in immortality: “In a moment, in
                              the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
                              incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
                              must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal
                              shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is
                              swallowed up in victory” (1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:52&nbsp;-&nbsp;54).</p>
                        <p>When does it happen? At the last trump, at the resurrection, at the coming of Jesus. Then it
                              will be said, “O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?” (1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:55).</p>
                        <p>“For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own
                              order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at His coming.” 1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:22,&nbsp;23.</p>
                        <p>So far we have learned that: (1) There is no life in the unclothed, bodiless state; and (2) It is
                              at the time of Christ’s coming that we will be made alive.</p>
                        <p>Let’s go back to 2 Corinthians 5. At this point in our passage Paul begins an evaluation of
                              the two bodies – the mortal body which we have now, and the immortal body which we will receive
                              at the resurrection. Keep in mind that the setting of this whole discussion is Paul’s encouragement
                              to his readers not to become discouraged with present afflictions. Not only will the resurrected body
                              be incorruptible and eternal, there is another factor which will make it far more to be desired than
                              the present life. That factor is the presence of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>This theme of being with the Lord is found also in Paul’s first letter to the Thessalonians:
                              “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and
                              with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain
                              shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever
                              be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words” (1 Thessalonians 4:16-18).</p>
                        <p>As Paul considered the two bodies, the present and the future life, he longed for the privilege
                              available only in the future life, of being bodily with the Lord. Therefore, he continues in 2
                              Corinthians 5:6-8, “we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the [present]
                              body, we are absent from the Lord: (For we walk by faith, not by sight:) We are confident, I say, and
                              willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.”</p>
                        <p>Keep in mind that Paul is not describing an unclothed, bodiless state. He is referring to the
                              time when he will receive the immortal body. The body from which he will then be absent is his
                              present earthly body, but he will not be bodiless (naked) at that time. He has made that very clear in
                              the preceding verses.</p>
                        <p>Notice again in 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17, how Paul expected to get present with the Lord.
                              He describes the glorious coming of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and the translation of the
                              living saints. Then he says, “And so shall we ever be with the Lord.” That word “so” means, “thus,
                              in this way, or by this means”. Hence Paul is saying, “This is how we will get to be with the Lord.”</p>
                        <p>Since it is by means of the coming of Christ and the resurrection that we will get to be with
                              the Lord, then it is obvious that we will not be with the Lord before that time.</p>
                        <p>So it is clear from the above facts that when Paul spoke of being absent from the body and
                              present with the Lord, he was not thinking of the time when he would be dead. He was not earnestly
                              desiring death. He was looking beyond the grave, beyond the resurrection, to that glorious moment
                              when he would greet Jesus face to face, and live with him for ever.</p>
                        <h3 id="2">&#35;2: Paul’s Desire to Depart and Be with Christ</h3>
                        <p>Another passage which has confused some people is Philippians 1:20-25. Some have used
                              these verses to promote a doctrine which is contrary to Paul’s own clear teachings on the subject of
                              death. But when we look at it objectively we find the passage to be fully consistent with the rest of
                              the Bible.</p>
                        <p>Highlighting a few phrases in the passage will show us Paul’s train of thought. He is
                              discussing his earnest expectation, his hope, what he shall choose, having a desire, and what is more
                              needful. These are not expressions one uses when presenting a doctrinal discourse. He is opening
                              to his readers his deepest personal aspirations.</p>
                        <p>Paul’s greatest desire in this passage is that Christ shall be magnified in his body, whether
                              it be by life, or by death. The problem is that he cannot tell which is best, to live or to die. He wants
                              to do that which will best glorify Christ.</p>
                        <p>He longs to be with Christ. He knows that he will be with Him in the next life. This thought
                              is wonderful to him. Yet, realizing that his labors are still needed in this life, he concludes, I know
                              that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith.</p>
                        <p>The phrase which some people have stumbled over is Paul’s desire to depart, and to be with
                              Christ. Notice that he does not say that he will depart and immediately be with Christ. Neither is he
                              discussing a bodiless presence with Him; for his desire was that Christ shall be magnified in his
                              body.</p>
                        <p>For the purposes of his present discussion he sees no need to digress into the details of the
                              decomposition of his body, the oblivion of death’s sleep, and the specifics of the resurrection. That
                              is not the subject at hand. Yet, even so, the words he uses describe the experience of death most
                              explicitly. To the individual’s consciousness, death does not register at all. Thousands of years may
                              pass. The dead know nothing of it. Their first conscious moment at the resurrection knows of no
                              lapse since their last conscious moment before death. After Paul’s death, the next thing he would
                              know, is that he would be with Christ. His description is experiential rather than technical, and thus
                              perfectly harmonizes with his direct doctrinal instruction on the state of the dead.</p>
                        <p>When did Paul expect to be with Christ? In 2 Thessalonians 2:1 he clearly explains that the
                              coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together unto him take place at the same time.</p>
                        <p>In Colossians 3:4 Paul says, “When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also
                              appear with him in glory.” We will not be with Christ in glory until His appearing, His glorious
                              return in power and majesty</p>
                        <p>Paul also speaks of the appearing of Christ in 2 Timothy 4:8: “Henceforth there is laid up for
                              me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not
                              to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.” Paul realized that his crown of
                              righteousness would be laid up in store for him, until the coming of Christ, not to be received until
                              that day.</p>
                        <h3 id="3">&#35;3: The Transfiguration</h3>
                        <p>Does the appearance of Moses and Elijah at Christ’s transfiguration (Matthew 17:3) prove
                              that the saints of olden days are now in heaven?</p>
                        <p>The case of Elijah is easy when we remember that Enoch and Elijah never died, but were
                              translated to heaven (Hebrews 11:5; 2 Kings 2:11).</p>
                        <p>Moses, however, did die (Deuteronomy 34:5); but then something very interesting happened.
                              Jude 9 mentions a dispute between Michael and the devil over the dead body of Moses. The devil
                              was rebuked, and the Lord’s plan prevailed. Deuteronomy 34:6 says that Moses was buried, “but no
                              man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.” David, on the other hand, “is both dead and buried, and
                              his sepulchre is with us unto this day” (Acts 2:29). Why the difference? Moses’ appearance on the
                              mount of transfiguration indicates that he was bodily resurrected from the dead.</p>
                        <p>Moses did not go to heaven as a bodiless spirit; the Lord claimed his body as well (Jude 9).
                              Neither did Elijah leave his body on earth; for fifty strong men searched for him for three days and
                              found nothing (2 Kings 2:17). Jesus Himself ascended bodily to heaven. In all the Bible there is not
                              a single example of anyone ever going to heaven except as a living body.</p>
                        <p>Moses is not the only one who has been resurrected and taken to heaven. When Jesus died,
                              “many bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after his resurrection”
                              (Matthew 27:52, 53); so that “when he ascended up on high, he led a multitude of captives”
                              (Ephesians 4:8, margin).</p>
                        <p>The fact that Moses was alive and bodily present when Jesus was transfigured provides
                              support, not for the doctrine of natural immortality, but for the doctrine of the resurrection.</p>
                        <h3 id="4">&#35;4: The Thief on the Cross</h3>
                        <p>Some people have suggested that the dialog recorded in Luke 23:42, 43 indicates that the
                              righteous go immediately to paradise when they die.</p>
                        <p>If so, in order for Christ to be true to His promise, both He and the thief would have had to
                              make it to heaven before the sun set that very day.</p>
                        <p>to heaven before the sun set that very day.
                              Let’s see if they actually did. First, did Jesus go to heaven that day? The Bible tells us that
                              He did not. For when He was resurrected He said, “I am not yet ascended to my Father” (John
                              20:17).</p>
                        <p>So Jesus didn’t go to heaven that day. What about the thief: did he? The Bible tells us in
                              John 19:31-34 that at the end of the day the soldiers went and found the two thieves still hanging
                              there on the cross, both still alive. Then they broke their legs and let them down off the cross for the
                              Sabbath. So the thief didn’t make it to heaven that day either.</p>
                        <p>Well then, did Jesus tell a lie? No. The problem is easily solved when we realize that when
                              the Bible was written, there were no punctuation marks. Commas were added hundreds of years later
                              when the Bible was translated into English. In Luke 23:43 the comma should have been placed after,
                              rather than before, the word today. It actually reads, “Verily I say unto thee today, thou shalt be with
                              me in paradise.”</p>
                        <p>Jesus gave him that day a promise that He will not break. “For when the Son of man shall
                              come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him,...then shall the King say...Inherit the kingdom
                              prepared for you” (Matthew 25:31-34). “For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father
                              with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works” (Matthew 16:27).</p>
                        <p>And that’s all the thief was asking for anyway. He didn’t ask to go to heaven that day. He
                              simply said, “Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom” (Luke 23:42).</p>
                        <h3 id="5">&#35;5: Jesus Preaching to Dead People</h3>
                        <p>Some have wondered that while Jesus was dead if He could have taken the opportunity to
                              preach to other people who were also dead. The question comes from 1 Peter 3:18-20, a passage
                              which now deserves our close attention.</p>
                        <p>It is always important to remember that the Bible does not contradict itself. Whatever this
                              verse says must be in harmony with what the rest of the Bible teaches on this subject. Otherwise it
                              could not be the inspired word of God.</p>
                        <p>Isaiah 38:18 states, “The grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go
                              down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.” There would be no point in Jesus preaching to those
                              who cannot have hope.</p>
                        <p>The Bible also states that “the dead know not any thing” (Ecclesiastes 9:5). So preaching to
                              the dead does not fit in with the Biblical description of death.</p>
                        <p>Let’s look at 1 Peter 3:18-20 to see what it says and does not say. Verse 18 tells us that Jesus
                              was put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit. The word quickened means brought to life.
                              It is when they are raised to life again that the dead are quickened (John 5:21).</p>
                        <p>Our passage in 1 Peter 3 does not tell us when Jesus was quickened. We are simply told two
                              things: (1) that Jesus was put to death, and (2) that He was brought back to life. To find out when
                              He was brought to life we must go to the actual account in the gospels. It tells us that He was
                              crucified on the day of the preparation (Matthew 27:62), and brought back to life on the first day of
                              the week (Matthew 28:1). Thus the Scriptural account is clear.</p>
                        <p>Our passage says that Jesus was quickened by the Spirit. That is, the Holy Spirit. Jesus
                              Himself declared that it is the spirit that quickeneth (John 6:63).</p>
                        <p>So by comparing Scripture with Scripture we have a very good explanation of verse 18. Jesus
                              was put to death in the flesh on Friday afternoon, and raised to life again by the Spirit on Sunday
                              morning.</p>
                        <p>The next three words in our passage are “by which also”. The word “also” indicates the
                              introduction of a different event, the common factor being the involvement of the Holy Spirit. Christ
                              was resurrected by the Spirit, He also by the Spirit preached.</p>
                        <p>Christ, by the Spirit, preached unto the spirits in prison. The word “spirits” in this verse
                              simply means people. Often in the Bible a figure of speech is used by which a characteristic part of
                              a thing stands for the whole. Since the spirit or breath of a person is a characteristic part of the
                              person, the word “spirit” is sometimes used to represent the person. For example, in 1 Corinthians
                              16:18 “my spirit” simply means me. In Galatians 6:18 and 2 Timothy 4:22 your (thy) spirit simply
                              means you.</p>
                        <p>The prison concept is elsewhere used in the Bible in reference to the condition of those who
                              are entrapped in sin. “The wicked...shall be holden with the cords of his sins” (Proverbs 5:22). “For
                              of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage” (2 Peter 2:19). The work of the
                              gospel is to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound
                              (Isaiah 61:1. See also Isaiah 42:7, 22).</p>
                        <p>With that thought, 1 Peter 3:19 simply says that it was through His Holy Spirit also that
                              Christ preached to people bound in sin. Notice that verse 19 does not tell us when this preaching
                              took place. To find that out we must go to verse 20 which says: “Which sometime were disobedient,
                              when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing.”
                              There it is. Verses 19 and 20 are talking about what happened in the days of Noah!</p>
                        <p>it is. Verses 19 and 20 are talking about what happened in the days of Noah!
                              Noah was called a preacher of righteousness (2 Peter 2:5). Through his preaching the Holy
                              Spirit worked upon the hearts of the people. But because of the wickedness of that generation and
                              their refusal to obey God, the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also
                              is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years (Genesis 6:3). For 120 years Noah
                              preached. Those people had more opportunity to hear and accept the gospel than any other
                              generation. Yet, few, that is, eight souls were saved. When those 120 years were up, their opportunity
                              for salvation was forever gone. They would hear no more preaching.</p>
                        <p>Peter does not say that Jesus did anything while He was dead. He, by the Spirit, preached to
                              the people in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing.</p>
                        <p>And that’s all the text says. It says nothing about a purgatory. It makes no mention of
                              disembodied spirits, and it says nothing about preaching to dead people.</p>
                        <p>1 Peter 4:6 tells us that the gospel was (past tense) preached to people who are (present tense)
                              dead. They are dead now, but nowhere does it say that they were dead at the time the gospel was
                              preached to them. Such a claim would contradict everything the Bible teaches about death, salvation,
                              and the justice of God. “The living, the living, he shall praise thee,...the father to the children shall
                              make known thy truth” (Isaiah 38:19).</p>
                        <h3 id="6">&#35;6: Stephen’s Spirit</h3>
                        <p>What happened to Stephen’s spirit when he died? The same thing that happens to everyone’s
                              spirit when they die. The verse is Acts 7:59-60. As Stephen was being stoned, he was calling upon
                              God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</p>
                        <p>Your spirit is simply the spark of life which belongs to God. You lose it when you die. When
                              the Bible says that the breath of life returns to God, it does not say that it carries with it any portion
                              of your mental capacity. Human consciousness is a physiological process which is dependent upon
                              nerve and tissue. In reference to man, the Bible never speaks of any consciousness of disembodied
                              spirits.</p>
                        <h3 id="7">&#35;7: Baptism for the Dead</h3>
                        <p>Does Paul teach in 1 Corinthians 15:29 that we should be baptized for the dead? No, he
                              does not.</p>
                        <p>This chapter is discussing the resurrection. Whatever conclusion we reach as to the meaning
                              of this verse, we must recognize it as an argument in favor of the resurrection. The line of reasoning
                              goes as follows: “Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all?
                              Why are they then baptized for the dead?” He is promoting, not consciousness during death, but
                              resurrection after death.</p>
                        <p>Paul here may have been referring to a pagan custom of being baptized for the dead. Notice
                              that he uses the word “they” rather than “we”. He does not say, we should be baptized for the dead.
                              He simply says that they are. Without actually endorsing their practice, he was saying, Even the
                              pagans who are baptized for the dead believe there will be a resurrection. Else why would they be
                              baptized for them? The argument is similar to verses 16-18 where Paul says, “For if the dead rise
                              not,.. then they also which are fallen asleep...are perished.” The only hope for the dead is in the
                              resurrection.</p>
                        <p>The Bible clearly teaches that a man must personally repent, believe in Christ, confess his
                              sins, and be baptized in order to be saved (Acts 2:38; John 3:16; 1 John 1:9). You can only “work
                              out your own salvation” (Philippians 2:12). “They shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall
                              but deliver their own souls by their righteousness” (Ezekiel 14:20). “None of them can by any means
                              redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him” (Psalm 49:7). “The soul that sinneth, it shall
                              die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the
                              son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall
                              be upon him” (Ezekiel 18:20).</p>
                        <p>Those who die in sin have no more opportunity to repent. “Behold, now is the accepted time;
                              behold, now is the day of salvation” (2 Corinthians 6:2). “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it
                              with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither
                              thou goest” (Ecclesiastes 9:10). Now, while we are still alive, while the blood still flows in our veins,
                              while we are still capable of responding to Christ’s invitation now is the time for us to give ourselves
                              fully to Jesus.</p>
                        <p>So we have discovered, by closely examining the various texts which many use to try and
                              promote the idea that there is consciousness after death, that not one text proves such an idea. But
                              on the contrary: the Bible texts on this subject clearly reveals that once a person dies, they “know
                              not anything”, and “also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished” (Ecclesiastes
                              9:5-6). Thus they remain in their graves without knowing “any thing that is done under the sun”
                              until they are resurrected.</p>
