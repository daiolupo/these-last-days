                        <h4>In modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works </h4>
                        <p>The Bible associates cosmetics and jewelry with the vain worldliness of the wicked:</p>
                        <p>“They had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.” Judges&nbsp;8:24.</p>
                        <p>“Jezebel...painted her face, and tired her head.” 2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;9:30.</p>
                        <p>“Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair.” Jeremiah 4:30.</p>
                        <p>“The Lord said,...wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations.” “That ye have sent for men to come from far,...for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments.” “Which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.” “Thus will I cause...that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.” Ezekiel 23:36-49.</p>
                        <p>“She decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the Lord.” Hosea 2:13.</p>
                        <p>“And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication.” Revelation 17:4.</p>
                        <p>Isaiah 3:16-24 provides a very revealing list of worldly decorations which the Lord rebukes among the daughters of Zion. In verse 9 He says, “The shew of their countenance doth witness against them.</p>
