            <h4>God</h4>
            <p>Daniel 4:17 The most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</p>
            <p>A nineteenth century writer once described God's sovereignty in these words:</p>
            <p>"Above the distractions of the earth He sits enthroned; all things are open to His divine survey; and from His great and calm eternity He orders that which His providence sees best."</p>
            <p>And God has not kept His plans secret:</p>
            <p>"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets." Amos&nbsp;3:7</p>
        </details>
        <h3>2. How long ago did God reveal or declare His plans? Isaiah&nbsp;46:10</h3>

            3. Where did the holy prophets of God in ancient times get their information?
            &nbsp;2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:21

            <summary>Answer</summary>
            <h4>The Holy Spirit</h4>
            <p>The Bible may be received "not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God."&nbsp;1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:13.</p>
        </details>
        <h3>4. What guarantee did the Psalmist give that the ancient words of God would still be trustworthy in the last days?&nbsp;Psalm&nbsp;12:6,&nbsp;7</h3>
        <textarea col="30" rows="5" maxlength="150"></textarea>
        <details>
            <summary>Answer</summary>
            <h4>Thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever</h4>
            <p>The apostle Peter expressed his confidence in the ancient prophecies and also their importance for us today:</p>
            <p>"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts."&nbsp;2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:19.</p>
            <p>The Bereans certainly took heed to the sure word of prophecy:</p>
            <p>"These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so."&nbsp;Acts17:11.</p>

        <h3>5. By what should we live our lives?&nbsp;Matthew&nbsp;4:4</h3>
        <textarea col="30" rows="5" maxlength="150"></textarea>
        <details>
            <summary>Answer</summary>
            <h4>By every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God</h4>
            <p>"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."&nbsp;2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:15.</p>
        </details>
        <h3>6. Is it safe for us to interpret the prophecies of the Bible?&nbsp;2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:20</h3>
        <textarea col="30" rows="5" maxlength="150"></textarea>
        <details>
            <summary>Answer</summary>
            <h4>No prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation</h4>
            <p>"Do not interpretations belong to God?" Genesis 40:8.</p>
            <p>Everyone interprets the Bible differently. That's why it is not safe to rely on anyone's interpretation, not even your own. Do not interpret the Bible; let the Bible interpret itself. When you read something in the Bible that you do not understand, instead of trusting your own ideas, look for other Bible verses that will explain the meaning of the more difficult passage.</p>
            <p>The Bible itself tells us how it is to be studied:" For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little."&nbsp;Isaiah&nbsp;28:10. Thus "comparing spiritual things with spiritual," Scripture with Scripture, we allow the Bible to explain itself.&nbsp;1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:13.</p>
            <p>We may be tempted to think that we have a natural ability to understand God's word, but we do not:</p>
            <p>"The natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them."&nbsp;1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:14.</p>

            <summary>Answer</summary>
            <h4>The Comforter...the Holy Ghost</h4>
            <p>Whenever we study the Bible we should always pray that the Holy Spirit will direct our thoughts and help us to understand His word.</p>
