                        <h4>A little book open</h4>
                        <p>Revelation 10 makes unmistakable reference to the book of Daniel:</p>
                    <h5>Daniel&nbsp;12:5-7.</h5>
                    <p>“Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river. And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.”</p>
                    <h5>Revelation&nbsp;10:5&nbsp;-&nbsp;7.</h5>
                    <p>“And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer: but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.”</p>
                  </details>

                        <h4>Peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues</h4>
                        <p>“Upon the sea and upon the earth.” Revelation 10:5. The book of Daniel was to be opened in an area occupied by many nations, and also in a sparsely-populated land.</p>
                    <p>In 1800 Daniel was a closed book. In 1812 the study of prophecy began in England. It soon took hold throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa.  Soon more than a hundred writers from a wide variety of denominations were interpreting Bible prophecy. Loosed by the hand of a prophetic clock, scores of men, representing over a dozen nations on four different continents, independently and simultaneously began predicting the fulfillment of the 2300-day prophecy.</p>
                    <p>In the United States, the most noted expositor of Daniel 8:14 was a Baptist, William Miller. He and 43 ministers of 13 denominations unleashed perhaps the greatest prophetic awakening in American history. By a thorough study of the 2300-day prophecy, they discovered that the 2300 days would expire on October 22, 1844.</p>

                  <p>“How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!” Psalm&nbsp;119:103.</p>

                        <h4>It shall make thy belly bitter</h4>
                        <p>It was commonly believed that the earth was the sanctuary to be cleansed, and that Jesus would come at the end of the 2300-day period. No message could have been sweeter. Many gladly gave up their jobs and spent their life’s savings to spread the wonderful news. But when the date passed by and Jesus did not return, they experienced the most bitter disappointment of their lives.</p>

The great trumpet is sounded; a still, small voice is heard; the angels shudder, saying, this is the day of judgment . . . .

                        <p>At no time in the world’s history has anyone ever earned salvation by his own works. In both Old
                              and New Testaments, people were saved by the grace of God and the merits of Jesus. The following texts
                              make it clear that people who lived before the cross were saved on the same terms as were people in
                              New Testament times</p>
                        <p>“I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one
                              that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.” Romans&nbsp;1:16.</p>
                        <p>“For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them.” Hebrews&nbsp;4:2.</p>
                        <p>“For by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.” Galatians&nbsp;2:16.</p>
                        <p>“Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among
                              men, whereby we must be saved.” Acts&nbsp;4:12.</p>
                        <p>“But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we
                              have preached unto you, let him be accursed.” Galatians&nbsp;1:8.</p>
                        <p>The Old Testament itself teaches salvation through Christ. The “scriptures” spoken of in the
                              following texts are the Old Testament. These texts make it clear that the Old Testament scriptures teach
                              the same gospel of salvation through Christ that we find in the New Testament.
                              “Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures.” 1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:3.</p>
                        <p>“From a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto
                              salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.” 2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:15.</p>
                        <p>“Then he said unto them, ‘O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:
                              Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?’ And
                              beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the
                              things concerning himself.” Luke&nbsp;24:25&nbsp;-&nbsp;27.</p>
                        <p>“All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
                              correction, for instruction in righteousness.” 2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:16.</p>
                        <p>The Bible presents one gospel from Genesis to Revelation, one plan of salvation for humanity.
                              The Bible calls it “the everlasting gospel” (Revelation&nbsp;14:6), the “everlasting covenant” (Psalm&nbsp;105:10;
                              Hebrews&nbsp;13:20).</p>
                        <h3>How People Before the Cross Demonstrated Their Faith in Christ</h3>
                        <p>The Bible says that we are saved by grace through faith. Faith, therefore, is the means by which we take hold of God’s grace.</p>
                        <p>Faith always exhibits itself in real and identifiable action. “I will shew thee my faith by my works.” James 2:18. Often the Lord has asked His people to express their faith through the performance of an action. Many of Christ’s miracles occurred in response to an act of faith.</p>
                        <p>This principle helps us to understand the purpose of the ceremonial ordinances of the Old Testament. Performing those ceremonies did not earn salvation for the Israelites, but served as the means whereby they were to demonstrate their faith in the Saviour who was to come.</p>
                        <p>Every sacrifice offered, every ordinance performed, was to be an expression of faith in Christ. “By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice.” Hebrews 11:4. “Through faith he [Moses] kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood.” Hebrews 11:28.</p>
                        <h3>The Significance of the Old Testament Sanctuary Services</h3>
                        <img src="../img/sanctuary.jpg" alt="The Sanctuary">
                        <p>Every element in the Old Testament ritual system was specifically designed by Christ to illustrate
                              His own work in the plan of salvation. Every lamb that was slain prefigured Christ, the Lamb of God,
                              who would be offered on the cross for the sins of the world. Everything the priests did pointed to Jesus,
                              our great High Priest in the courts above. In fact, even the way the Sanctuary and its furniture was
                              arranged was designed to illustrate the plan of salvation.</p>
                        <img src="../img/christ-sanctuary.jpg" alt="Christ in the Sanctuary">
                        <p>By just contemplating the meaning of the Sanctuary, its arrangement and the ceremonies
                              performed, an Israelite could understand the entire gospel of salvation. So the gospel of Christ is clearly
                              illustrated in the Old Testament, and it is definitely plainly proclaimed in the New Testament.</p>
                        <p>Since the plan of salvation is clearly seen connected in both the Old and the New Testaments,
                              and since the ceremonial system centered around the sanctuary and its services, then it should not
                              surprise us to find that every major scene in the book of Revelation is oriented with respect to the temple
                              in heaven where Christ is ministering for us. The heavenly temple is specifically mentioned 14 times in
                              Revelation (see 3:12; 7:15; 11:1, 2, 19; 14:15, 17; 15:5, 6, 8; 16:1, 17).</p>
                        <p>Revelation is full of sanctuary terminology. Twenty-eight times in Revelation Jesus is called the
                              “Lamb”. References to sanctuary furniture such as the candlesticks, the altar of incense, and the ark of
                              the testament are found throughout the book. Other references to the temple in heaven include Psalm
                              11:4; 18:6; Isaiah 6:1; Habakkuk 2:20; Malachi 3:1; and Hebrews 8 and 9.</p>
                        <p>The tabernacle on earth was patterned after the temple in heaven. It consisted of two apartments,
                              the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place, and specific services were carried out in each of these apartments – especially in regards to the Most Holy Place and the day of Atonement.</p>
                        <h3>Three Steps in the Atonement</h3>
                        <p>By studying the plan of salvation as illustrated in the Old Testament sanctuary services, we may
                              learn much about the great work of atonement.
                              The word “atonement,” or at-one-ment, refers to the process whereby man is reconciled to God. A study of the sanctuary reveals three steps in the process: sacrifice, intercession, and cleansing.</p>
                        <h5>Sacrifice</h5>
                        <p>This step was symbolized in the Old Testament by the daily slaying of animals. A perfect lamb
                              without blemish was required, and sacrificed in the courtyard. Every drop of blood that was shed in those
                              rituals pointed to the sacrifice of Jesus for lost mankind. His death paid the full price for our redemption</p>
                        <h5>Intercession</h5>
                        <p>This step was symbolized by the daily duties performed by the priests in the holy place, or first
                              apartment of the sanctuary. Incense was continually offered before God, mingled with the prayers of the
                              saints. This represented Christ’s priestly intercession for His people which He began after His ascension
                              to heaven. Through Christ’s first apartment ministry the sinner’s guilt is pardoned, and Christ’s
                              righteousness is imparted to His people.</p>
                        <h5>Cleansing</h5>
                        <p>The third step was illustrated once each year in the Old Testament ceremonies. The tenth day of
                              the seventh month was called the Day of Atonement. It was the day on which the sanctuary was cleansed.
                              It was considered the most solemn and significant event of the year. On that day the whole congregation
                              appeared before the Lord that they might be made “at one” with Him. Sins which had been brought to
                              the sanctuary throughout the year were figuratively removed from it on that day. But those who failed
                              to humble themselves before God were cut off from being considered the people of God.</p>
                        <p>On that day the high priest alone went past the inner veil into the Most Holy Place and appeared
                              before God. With him he took the blood of a goat and a censer of coals from the altar of incense. This
                              represented the final phase of Christ’s work in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary, performed
                              in “the time of the end” to atone for all confessed sins. The work of atonement is not complete until the
                              sanctuary is thus cleansed.</p>
                        <p>Scripture references to the Old Testament Day of Atonement include Leviticus 16 and Leviticus
                              23:27-32. Information on the end-time cleansing of the sanctuary is found in Daniel 8:14; Malachi 3:1-5;
                              and Hebrews 8 and 9.</p>
                        <h3>Biblical Figures Which Illustrate Christ’s
                              End-Time Cleansing Work</h3>
                        <p>Lesson 16 covers the subject of Christ’s end-time cleansing work. But we would like to preview
                              the subject briefly here. There are at least four different figures which are used in the Bible to illustrate
                              the final, cleansing phase of Christ’s atoning ministry. They are summarized below.</p>
                        <h5>1. The Day of Atonement</h5>
                        <p>Since the Old Testament feasts such as Passover and Pentecost illustrated and pointed forward
                              to events in Christ’s work of salvation, we should also expect the Day of Atonement to point to a
                              significant aspect of Christ’s ministry. The Biblical description of the Day of Atonement presents it as
                              a day of cleansing for the sanctuary and the people.</p>
                        <h5>2. The Pre-Advent Judgment</h5>
                        <p>A second figure used in the Bible to illustrate Christ’s end-time cleansing work is that of a preadvent
                              judgment. That is, a judgment which Christ performs before He returns at His second coming.
                              Lesson 16 presents the texts referring to this event, which is often called the Investigative Judgment. It
                              involves an examination of the lives of all whose names have ever been entered into the book of life.</p>
                        <h5>3. Preparations for a Wedding</h5>
                        <p>Elsewhere in the Bible the cleansing phase of Christ’s ministry is compared to preparations made
                              for a wedding. The wedding parables of Jesus in chapters 22 and 25 of Matthew speak of an essential
                              preparation on the part of the those who are invited to the wedding feast. Symbolically we are each
                              individually called to be guests at the wedding of Christ and His church. The marriage appears in
                              Revelation 19:7-9 just before Christ comes back to earth to receive His bride. In Matthew 22:11 the king
                              personally inspects each guest to make sure they are each wearing the wedding garment. Revelation 19:8
                              tells us that this white raiment is “the righteousness of saints.” Only those who by God’s grace overcome
                              their sins (Revelation 3:5) are clothed in the required garment. This preparation and inspection of
                              character before the wedding illustrates the end-time cleansing ministry of Christ.</p>
                        <h5>4. Refining of Gold and Silver</h5>
                        <p>A fourth Biblical description of Christ’s end-time cleansing work is found in Malachi&nbsp;3 where
                              the Lord comes to His temple and sits “as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of
                              Levi, and purge them as gold and silver” (verse 3).</p>
                        <p>In the purification process of silver, the refiner works so that all the impurities and worthless
                              dross are removed from the precious metal. To accomplish this he continues to raise the temperature
                              of the fire in the melting pot, and as the silver melts, all the dross and impurities rise to the surface which
                              are skimmed off and discarded. But if the refiner allows the temperature to get too hot, then the precious
                              silver will be ruined. So what the refiner has to do is to keep a close watch on the surface of the silver.
                              As soon as the silver takes on a mirrored appearance, and the refiner can see his face reflected back to
                              him, then he immediately removes the heat because the silver has been thoroughly purged and purified.</p>
                        <p>It is very comforting and encouraging to know that Jesus – our Refiner – not only examines our
                              lives, but also works to purge, refine and cleanse us from all our sins and imperfections. He will not
                              allow any trial to overwhelm us, nor will He needlessly keep the fires of purification on us for too long,
                              because He loves us and wants us to be saved, not lost. And He, along with all of heaven, will continue
                              working for and with us towards perfectly reflecting His righteous character. Thus the strongest
                              influences of heaven are working to help you and me to separate ourselves from sin’s destroying hold.</p>
                        <p>So God is on our side. He wants us to obtain the victory. It has been said that there are three votes
                              which determine each person’s eternal destiny. Satan always votes against you. God always votes for
                              you. The deciding vote is left to you.</p>
                        <h3>Where We Stand Today</h3>
                        <p>We now live in the period of Christ’s ministry which the Bible depicts in the above four ways.
                              The cleansing of the sanctuary is going on today. It began, according to prophecy, at the end of the “2300
                              days” of Daniel 8:14. The first “seventy weeks” of that prophecy pointed to the time of Christ’s sacrifice
                              on Calvary. The remaining 1810 years of the prophecy point to the time when the cleansing of the
                              sanctuary would commence: the autumn of 1844 (see <a href="lesson14.html">lesson 14</a>).</p>
                        <h3>How We Arrive at the Date, October 22, 1844</h3>
                        <p>We have noted that every ceremony which God gave to Israel had significance in illustrating
                              some aspect of Christ’s ministry. The first-month feasts, also known as spring festivals (Passover, the
                              Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Wavesheaf Offering, and Pentecost), all pointed to events connected
                              with Christ’s sacrifice and intercessory ministry. The seventh-month feasts, or autumn festivals
                              (Trumpets, the Day of Atonement, and the Feast of Tabernacles), pointed to events connected with the
                              final phase of the atonement and the eradicating of sin from the universe.</p>
                        <p>Christ’s fulfillment of the events to which each of the spring festivals pointed took place on the
                              very date of the corresponding ceremonial service in the Jewish calendar. In other words, He actually
                              died on Passover day, was raised on the day of the wave sheaf offering, and the Holy Spirit was poured
                              out on the day of Pentecost. We therefore know that He would begin the work to which the Day of
                              Atonement pointed on that date of the Jewish calendar in 1844, which was October 22.</p>
                        <h3>The Misunderstanding in 1844</h3>
                        <p>The disappointed expectations for Christ’s return in 1844 were the result of a misunderstanding
                              as to which sanctuary was to be cleansed. But before we criticize those believers we need to remember
                              that the prophet Daniel misunderstood the same thing. Daniel received the vision of the 2300-day
                              prophecy in 551 B.C. But Gabriel did not provide a full explanation of the prophecy until the first year
                              of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, which was 538 B.C. Chapter nine reveals that during those 13 years
                              Daniel held a misunderstanding as to which sanctuary was to be cleansed. His concern was for the
                              temple in Jerusalem which he hoped would soon be restored. He certainly did not want to see it lay in
                              ruins for 2300 years. That was the reason for his great anxiety and earnest prayer.</p>
                        <p>William Miller began preaching on the 2300-day prophecy in the year 1831. Until 1844 people
                              incorrectly assumed that the sanctuary to be cleansed was the earth. Just like Daniel, for 13 years they
                              misunderstood which sanctuary was to be cleansed!</p>
                        <p>Because God may withhold the full light of truth from His people for a time does not mean that
                              He is not leading them. He has a reason for all that He does, and He unfolds His secrets as He sees best.
                              Our duty is to walk in the light as He reveals it, and He will guide us into all truth.</p>
                        <h3>The Close of Probation</h3>
                        <p>The wedding parable in Matthew 25 indicates that salvation is offered for a limited time only.
                              In the parable, those who were prepared for the bridegroom “went in with him to the marriage: and the
                              door was shut.” After the door was shut no one else who sought entrance was allowed in. They were too
                              late.</p>
                        <p>Jesus compared His coming to the days of Noah. For 120 years people had opportunity to
                              respond to Noah’s invitation. But once the door was shut, no one else could enter.</p>
                        <p>Jesus is now inviting all who will respond, to allow Him to cleanse them from sin. He is now
                              pleading the merits of His own sacrifice on behalf of all who will choose it. But when His ministry in
                              the heavenly sanctuary is finished and everyone on earth has either cooperated with or rejected His
                              atoning work, He will then leave the sanctuary. His work of intercession ceases. Those who during the
                              time of probation have made an entire consecration of their lives to Him are at that time sealed from the
                              power of Satan. They will sin no more. But those who spurned God’s grace while Jesus pleaded, will
                              find no mediator when probation ends. They had chosen to retain their sins, and their decision cannot
                              be reversed.</p>
                        <p>Revelation 15:5-8 describes the scene after Jesus leaves the temple. The sanctuary is empty; its
                              activities have ended. The wrath of God is now poured out upon the unrepentant. The plagues which
                              then will fall upon the world are described in Revelation&nbsp;16.</p>
                        <p>But those who had made the Lord their refuge will have His protection during the time of trouble
                              (see Isaiah 4:4-6; 26:20; and 33:16). The beautiful ninety-first Psalm also describes the protection to be
                              enjoyed by the righteous during that time. Take time to read and memorize these passages so they will
                              be in your heart to strengthen and encourage you in the days ahead.</p>
