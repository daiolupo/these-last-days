                <h2>The Worldâ€™s Greatest Time Prophecy</h2>
                <p>You are about to study the longest and most significant time prophecy in the Bible. Given more than 500 years before the death of Christ, it accurately pinpoints the time of His sacrifice. And as the only place in the Old Testament that speaks of a coming "Messiah" by that term, it ranks at the top of all Messianic prophecies. Yet this prophecy, found in the eighth and ninth chapters of the book of Daniel, moves beyond the earthly ministry of Christ to provide a panorama of His present work for us in the courts of heaven.</p>
                <p>We will cover the prophecy in three lessons. In the first we will concentrate on establishing the time elements involved. The next two lessons will take us into the throne room of God, opening to our understanding the special work of Jesus for us in these last days.</p>
                <p>You will remember from <a href="lesson2.html" target="_blank">lesson&nbsp;2</a> that the prophecy of Daniel 8 begins with a ram and a goat. After discussing the goat's horns, the vision then turns to the activities of the little horn, which magnifies itself to defy heaven, casting truth to the ground and trampling upon the sanctuary and the host.</p>
                  <h3>1. How long would the sanctuary and the host be trodden upon? Daniel&nbsp;8:13,&nbsp;14</h3>

                        <h4>Gabriel</h4>
                        <p>The angel began to explain the vision. He told Daniel that the ram represented Medo-Persia; the goat and its horns represented Greece.  He enlarged a little on the activities of the little horn, but said nothing more about the time factor involved.</p>
                  </details>   
                  <h3>3. When Gabriel stopped short of a full explanation, what happened to Daniel? Daniel&nbsp;8:27</h3>

                        <p>"Afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it." Daniel&nbsp;8:27.</p>
                  </details> 
                <h3>4. When Gabriel finally returned to explain the time portion of the vision, how much of the 2300 days did he say was designated for the Jewish people? Daniel&nbsp;9:21&nbsp;-&nbsp;24</h3>

                        <h4>Seventy weeks</h4>
                        <p>Seventy weeks is 490 days. Subtract that from the total 2,300 days, and 1,810 days of the prophecy are left.</p>
                  </details>
                <h3>5. In Bible prophecy, God has appointed a short unit of time to represent a longer time period. What scale does He use? Ezekiel&nbsp;4:6</h3>

                        <p>"Each day for a year." Numbers&nbsp;14:34.</p>
                    <p>Applying this rule, 2,300 prophetic days is actually 2,300 literal  years, the first 490 of which pertained to the Jews.</p>

                        <h4>Messiah the Prince</h4>
                        <p>Sixty-nine weeks is 483 prophetic days. From the autumn of 457 B.C., 483 years takes us to the autumn of A.D. 27. According to the prophecy, that is when the Messiah would appear. "Messiah" is the Hebrew word for "Anointed one". The Bible tells us that "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power." Acts&nbsp;10:38.</p>
                    <p>That anointing took place at His baptism (John&nbsp;1:32). Jesus was baptized in the autumn of A.D. 27, the precise time foretold in Daniel's prophecy.</p>

                        <p>That "week" would be the last seven years of the "70&nbsp;-&nbsp;week" portion of the prophecy. It extended from the autumn of A.D.&nbsp;27 to the autumn of A.D.&nbsp;34.</p>
                    <p>In the spring of A.D.&nbsp;31, exactly half way through that seven-year period, Jesus brought to an end the whole system of sacrifices and oblations by offering Himself as the Lamb of God, to whom the whole sacrificial system had pointed.</p>

                        <p>The "seventy-week" portion of the 2,300 years ended in A.D.&nbsp;34. In that year Israel's probationary time ceased, and they sealed their rejection of Christ by stoning Stephen. With the Jews no longer God's chosen people, the gospel began to be proclaimed to the Gentiles, and the Christian church inherited all the privileges promised to the descendants of Abraham (Galatians&nbsp;3:29). The temple and the city of Jerusalem were destroyed by Roman armies in A.D.&nbsp;70 (Daniel&nbsp;9:26,&nbsp;27; Mark&nbsp;13:14).</p>
