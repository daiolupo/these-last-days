                       <h4>Quench not the Spirit. Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things; hold fast that which is good</h4>
                </details>

                       <h4>To the law and to the testimony</h4>
                      <p>The first and most important test of a prophet is that his message is in harmony with the law of God and the testimony of earlier prophets.</p>
                </details>
              <h3>6. How does a false prophet’s appearance deceive people? Matthew&nbsp;7:15</h3>

                     <summary>Answer</summary>
                       <h4>That he should not return from his wicked way</h4>
                      <p>The second test of a prophet is the fruit of his ministry. Does his own life reveal God’s character? Does his work bear the marks of the high and holy calling of God. Are people’s lives elevated through his influence?</p>
                </details>
            <h3>9. What does the accuracy of a prophet’s predictions indicate? Jeremiah&nbsp;28:9</h3>

                       <h4>When the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly sent him</h4>
                </details>
            <h3>10. What would inaccuracy of prediction indicate? Deuteronomy&nbsp;18:21,&nbsp;22</h3>
                  <textarea col="30" rows="5" maxlength="150"></textarea>
                <details>
                     <summary>Answer</summary>
                       <h4>If the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken</h4>
                </details>
            <h3>11. Yet even if a sign should come to pass, what in a prophet’s message would prove him to be false? Deuteronomy&nbsp;13:1&nbsp;-&nbsp;5</h3>
                  <textarea col="30" rows="5" maxlength="150"></textarea>
                <details>
                     <summary>Answer</summary>
                       <h4>To turn you away from the Lord</h4>
                      <p>The third test of a prophet is the accuracy of his predictions.  Predicting, however, is not the primary function of a prophet. A prophet’s work is to bear the messages which God gives, and those messages may or may not contain information about the future. But when God does reveal future events, we may be sure that it will happen just as He has foretold.</p>
                      <p>Sometimes God gives conditional prophecies. Jonah’s message of the fall of Nineveh, for example, was conditioned upon the response of the people.</p>
                      <p>Because Satan can also foretell certain events before they happen, fulfilled predictions cannot be considered conclusive evidence of the genuine gift of prophecy. But Satan cannot predict with 100% accuracy as God does. For this reason, when a prophet’s predictions are consistently fulfilled throughout his entire career, we must take it as evidence of his authenticity. We should then look for the other tests to be met as well.</p>

                       <h4>There remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me</h4>
                      <p>The effects of Daniel’s vision are described in detail in Daniel&nbsp;10:7&nbsp;-&nbsp;19.</p>
                      <ol>
                            <li>Daniel alone saw the vision. The men with him did not see it, but were afraid.</li>
                            <li>He lost all his own strength.</li>
                            <li>He lost consciousness, then heard a voice.</li>
                            <li>A hand touched him, which set him on his hands and knees.</li>
                            <li>He then arose to his feet.</li>
                            <li>He became dumb.</li>
                            <li>His lips were touched; he was able to speak.</li>
                            <li>There was no breath in him.</li>
                            <li>He was given strength.</li>
                      </ol>

            <h3>14. When the prophet Balaam heard the words of God and saw the vision of the Almighty, how was his physical condition described? Numbers&nbsp;24:4</h3>

                     <summary>Answer</summary>
                       <h4>Falling into a trance, but having his eyes open</h4>
                       <p>Although never a conclusive test of divine inspiration, supernatural phenomena accompanying a vision do lend credibility to a prophet’s message. But because Satan can counterfeit such signs, we cannot base our confidence in a prophet solely upon physical manifestations.</p>
                       <p>Physical signs are not always present when a prophet receives a revelation. God has often spoken to His prophets in dreams while they were sleeping.</p>

                       <h4>Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us</h4>
                      <p>Please also read 1 Corinthians Chapter 12, especially verses 4-11, 14-19, 28-30. The Bible does not say that a true believer has to have any one particular gift. Neither does it say that the believer may choose his gift. The Holy Spirit gives different gifts to different people, “dividing them severally as He will.”</p>
