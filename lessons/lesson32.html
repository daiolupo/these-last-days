										<textarea col="30" rows="5" maxlength="150"></textarea>
										<details>
											<summary>Answer</summary>
											<h4>Repent, and be baptized</h4>
										</details>
              <h3>8. Who will be saved? Mark&nbsp;16:16</h3>
										<textarea col="30" rows="5" maxlength="150"></textarea>
										<details>
											<summary>Answer</summary>
											<h4>He that believeth and is baptized</h4>
											<p>“Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” John 3:5.</p>
											<p>As an outward sign of an inward change, baptism is a public testimony that now you belong to Jesus. Its significance as the sign of the new birth is fully discussed in Romans 6. There Paul speaks of the transforming power of grace within the life of the believer. Baptism is also the means of becoming a member of the church (Compare Acts 2:41, 47).</p>
										</details>              
              <h3>9. What word, meaning “put in the grave,” is used to describe baptism? Romans&nbsp;6:4</h3>
										<textarea col="30" rows="5" maxlength="150"></textarea>
										<details>
											<summary>Answer</summary>
											<h4>Buried</h4>
											<p>Baptism symbolizes the death and burial of our sins. When a dead body is buried, it is more than sprinkled with dirt. For the same reason, we want our sins to be completely buried.</p>
											<p>The word baptism itself means to immerse. It was used in the textile industry long before the days of John the baptist. When cloth was “baptized” in the dye, it was not just sprinkled, but completely immersed in it.</p>
										</details>
              <h3>10. What word in verse 5 means buried? Romans&nbsp;6:5</h3>
										<textarea col="30" rows="5" maxlength="150"></textarea>
										<details>
											<summary>Answer</summary>
											<h4>Planted</h4>
										</details>
              <h3>11. Why was John baptizing in Aenon? John&nbsp;3:23</h3>
										<textarea col="30" rows="5" maxlength="150"></textarea>
										<details>
											<summary>Answer</summary>
											<h4>Because there was much water there</h4>
											<p>If John had been sprinkling, he would not have needed much water.</p>
										</details>
              <h3>12. As Jesus came up out of the water following His baptism, what did He see? Mark&nbsp;1:10</h3>
										<textarea col="30" rows="5" maxlength="150"></textarea>
										<details>
											<summary>Answer</summary>
											<h4>The heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him</h4>
										</details>
              <h3>13. What must be done to all nations before they are baptized? Matthew&nbsp;28:19</h3>
										<textarea col="30" rows="5" maxlength="150"></textarea>
										<details>
											<summary>Answer</summary>
											<h4>Teach all nations</h4>
											<p>God wants His people to be intelligent in regard to His truth. They are to be taught “to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you,” He says. Matthew 28:20.</p>
											<p>Baptism signifies conversion. Conversion requires the cooperation of the will. Under the conviction of the Holy Spirit, the person chooses to consecrate his life to God. He renounces his sins and by the power of God is born again to new life in Christ.</p>
											<p>The story of the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8:26-39) is an inspiring account of a man searching for truth. As he read the Scriptures, the Lord directed Philip to him to present the gospel of Jesus. Convicted of his need of Christ, the eunuch asked to be baptized. So Philip baptized him in a nearby body of water.</p>
											<p>Acts 19:1-5 tells of some people who were baptized more than once.  They had been baptized once at the preaching of John, but had not yet learned all the truth. Now, as Paul shared with them additional vital truths, their Christian experience was so enriched by the new light, they felt their need to be baptized again.</p>

              <h3>14. What is God’s invitation to those who have accepted His truth? Acts&nbsp;22:16</h3>
										<textarea col="30" rows="5" maxlength="150"></textarea>
										<details>
											<summary>Answer</summary>
											<h4>And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins</h4>
										</details>
              <h3>15. In what did God speak to Elijah? 1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;19:12</h3>
										<textarea col="30" rows="5" maxlength="150"></textarea>
										<details>
											<summary>Answer</summary>
											<h4>A still small voice</h4>
											<p>Not all voices can be trusted. Beware of voices which contradict the Scriptures. The voice of the Spirit to our conscience will never differ from the teachings of the Bible. He speaks to us through the Bible. Jesus said, “He shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak.” “For he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.” John 16:13, 14. The Holy Spirit comes to forcibly impress upon our minds the word of God. Never will He direct us any other way.</p>

              <h2>Congratulations!</h2>
							<p>If you have completed this Bible study series, I wish to express my congratulations! I hope and pray that this study has brought you to a closer relationship with Jesus Christ. I also hope that you have a deeper understanding of His character. When you fully surrender your whole being to Him, the Holy Spirit will empower you to become more like Christ. You won't keep God's law because you know what it says or because of fear but you will keep it because of your love for Jesus. The closer you come to Him through Bible study and prayer, the more perfect in love you'll become. God wants that for all humanity for He desires that no one should be lost. Will you join with the redeemed? Christ Jesus is waiting for you and knocking at the door of your heart. Let Him come in and watch the changes in your life!</p>
