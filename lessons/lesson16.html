                        <summary>Answer</summary>
                        <h4>My reward is with me</h4>
                        <p>The judgment for all who have ever entered Christ’s service actually takes place before He comes. This is illustrated in Matthew&nbsp;22 in the parable of a marriage which a certain king made for his son. Before the wedding begins, the king inspects the guests to see if all are clothed with the wedding garment (verse 11). Notice the parallel in Revelation:</p>
                        <p>“Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.” Revelation&nbsp;19:7,&nbsp;8</p>
                        <p>In the parable, having that robe determined whether one was accepted or cast out.</p>
                        <p>“Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” Matthew&nbsp;7:21.</p>
                        <p>“He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment.” Revelation&nbsp;3:5.</p>
                        <p>They “which have not defiled their garments,” but “have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,” “shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.” Revelation&nbsp;3:4;&nbsp;7:14.</p>
                        <p>This character examination is performed by Christ in the heavenly sanctuary. When His investigation is completed, everyone’s destiny will be sealed. He will then announce:</p>
                        <p>“He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.” Revelation&nbsp;22:11,&nbsp;12.</p>

              <h3>9. What is the message that must be preached with a loud voice today? Revelation&nbsp;14:7</h3>
                    <textarea col="30" rows="5" maxlength="150"></textarea>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Answer</summary>
                        <h4>Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come</h4>
                        <p>Paul spoke in terms of “judgment to come” (Acts&nbsp;24:25).</p>
                    <p>The message for today is that “judgment is come” (Revelation&nbsp;14:7).</p>
                    <p>When Jesus comes, “He hath judged” (Revelation&nbsp;19:2).</p>
                    <p>This investigative judgment, which evaluates the lives of all who have ever professed faith in Christ, is completed before Jesus comes.  It should not be confused with the judgment of the wicked by Christ and His saints, which occurs during the millennium; or the final judgment and punishment of the wicked, which takes place at the end of the 1000 years (See <a href="lesson5.html" target="_blank">lesson 5)</a>.</p>

                        <h4>One like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him</h4>
                        <p>This movement of Christ does not describe His coming to the earth, but rather to “the Ancient of days.” The same scene is described by the prophet Malachi. Notice the question that is asked, and its answer:</p>
                    <p>“Where is the God of JUDGMENT? Behold I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his TEMPLE.” Malachi&nbsp;2:17&nbsp;-&nbsp;3:1.</p>
                    <p>Revelation&nbsp;10 describes the bitter disappointment of those who expected Jesus to come in 1844 (See <a href="lesson15.html" target="_blank">lesson&nbsp;15</a>). When He did not come, their question was, “Where is the God of judgment?” The Bible’s answer was, “The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple.” Jesus moved in 1844 into the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary to begin His work of investigative judgment, His final work before coming to earth to receive His bride.</p>
                    <p>From Daniel&nbsp;8:19 we learned that the sanctuary would be cleansed “at the time appointed.” Commenting on that, Paul says, “He hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world.” Acts&nbsp;17:31.  The time appointed for the judgment was the fulfillment of the 2300 days.</p>
