                <h2>Remember Now thy Creator</h2>
                <p>In Revelation&nbsp;14:6&nbsp;-&nbsp;12 we find three angels bearing solemn messages to the inhabitants of the earth. The first proclaims that the hour of God’s judgment has come. (Remember, the judgment began at the end of the “2300 days” of Daniel&nbsp;8&nbsp;and&nbsp;9.) The second angel announces the fall of modern spiritual Babylon. And the third warns against worshipping the beast and his image and receiving his mark.</p>
                <p>Once the messages have been proclaimed to all the world, “the harvest of earth” is reaped (Revelation&nbsp;14:15). “The harvest is the end of the world.” Matthew&nbsp;13:39.</p>
                <p>The three angels’ messages, therefore, constitute Heaven’s appeal to humanity in these last days of earth’s history. As such, they deserve the full attention of all who would prepare themselves for the final events.</p>
                <p>Matthew&nbsp;24:14  “And this GOSPEL of the kingdom shall be PREACHED in all the world for a witness unto ALL NATIONS; and then shall the end come.” </p>
                <p>Revelation&nbsp;14:6  “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting GOSPEL to PREACH unto them that dwell on the earth, and to EVERY NATION, and kindred, and tongue, and people.”</p>

                        <h4>For thou hast created all things</h4>
                        <p>Throughout the Scriptures, the fact that God created all things is presented as that which sets Him above all false gods, and makes Him alone worthy of our worship (1&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;16:25,&nbsp;26; Jeremiah&nbsp;10:11,&nbsp;12; Isaiah&nbsp;45:18).</p>
                    <p>While modern scientists vainly attempt to disprove creation, the first angel of Revelation 14 proclaims a message designed to draw the attention of the world to “Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.”</p>
