                        <h4>The ten commandments</h4>
                        <p>The ark containing the commandments is depicted in Revelation as being in the sanctuary in heaven. God’s commandments constitute the law of His universal government. The Psalmist declares that God’s kingdom “ruleth over all,” and that all the angels “do his commandments.” Psalm 103:19, 20. The Ten Commandments are recorded in Exodus&nbsp;20:3&nbsp;-&nbsp;17.</p>

                        <p>“He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.” 1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:4.</p>
                        <p>“By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous.” 1&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:2,&nbsp;3.</p>

                    <p>As an example to us, Jesus was careful to “fulfil all righteousness.” Matthew&nbsp;3:15.</p>

                    <p>“Ye have heard that it was said..., Thou shalt not commit adultery:</p>
                    <p>But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.” Matthew&nbsp;5:27,&nbsp;28.</p>

                        <h4>The ordinance of the passover</h4>
                        <p>In Old Testament times God’s people performed ceremonial ordinances involving burnt offerings and the sprinkling of blood (Ezekiel 43:18). While it was not the blood of bulls and goats which took away their sins (Hebrews 10:4), such ordinances were a means of demonstrating their faith in Christ and obtaining His righteousness by faith (Hebrews 11:4, 28). Since they served only as a foreshadowing of Christ, those provisional laws were no longer needed after His death.</p>

                        <h4>God spake all these words</h4>
                        <p>We must not confuse the ceremonial ordinances with the moral law which is summarized in the Ten Commandments. As God does not change (James&nbsp;1:17), neither do His commandments. God’s commandments are His righteousness (Psalm&nbsp;119:172) which He puts in us when He justifies us (Compare Romans&nbsp;3:22 with Hebrews&nbsp;10:16,&nbsp;17).</p>

                        <p>Jesus then could have eliminated sin without having to suffer. All He would have to do is change the law. Rewrite the law, and there would be no more violation, no need for anyone to pay the penalty. Christ would not have had to die.</p>
                    <p>The very fact that Christ died is the strongest proof that He would not change His law. For “it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.” Luke&nbsp;16:17.</p>

                        <h3>Information Booklet E</h3>
                        <h4>Supplement to lesson 18</h4>
                        <h5>(Numbers in parenthesis refer to footnotes at the end of the document.)</h5>
                        <p>The Scripture texts presented in Lesson 18 show clearly that God’s commandments are just
                              as binding upon Christians today as they were when God spoke them upon Mt. Sinai. However,
                              some people have developed the idea that Christians have no obligation to keep the Ten
                              Commandments. The purpose of this booklet is to discuss those objections and to demonstrate the
                              unity of the Scriptures on the subject.</p>
                              <h3>The Word “Law” in the Bible</h3>
                        <p>The first thing we need to understand is what the Bible writers meant when they referred to
                              “the law.” The primary Hebrew word translated “law” in the Old Testament is “torah”, which is so
                              translated 216 times. In the New Testament, the word “law” is generally the Greek word “nomos”,
                              which occurs 195 times.</p>
                              <h3>Old Testament Usage</h3>
                        <p>To the Hebrew mind, “law” was a broad term which stood for God’s revealed will. It
                              encompassed all divine instruction, all God’s communication of His purpose for man. To the devout
                              Israelite, God’s “law” was equivalent to His plan for the salvation of man.</p>
                        <p>The context of an Old Testament passage using the word “law” may indicate that the writer
                              is referring to a particular portion of God’s revealed will. God’s instructions given through Moses
                              became known as “the Law of Moses.” Because the first five books of the Bible contained those
                              instructions, that portion of Scripture was often called “the law of Moses” or simply “the law.” To
                              the Hebrew mind, God’s instructions were His law, whether those instructions were moral standards,
                              ritual requirements, or national policies. This general view of the law explains why the term can
                              actually refer to a variety of things, the distinction between which was not necessarily considered
                              significant since it all came from God.</p>
                              <h3>New Testament Usage</h3>
                        <p>By New Testament times, two distinct meanings of the term “law” had emerged, both of
                              which reflected the thinking of the Jews in regard to the law as described above.</p>
                        <p>First: since the Scriptures were the place where God’s revealed will was preserved, the term
                              “law” began to designate the Old Testament Scriptures as a whole or in part.<a href="#1" id="I">(1)</a> Often the term
                              referred to the Pentateuch, or books of Moses, as distinguished from the Prophets and the Writings;
                              and at times to the Decalogue (Ten Commandments) as a part of the Pentateuch.</p>
                        <p>Secondly: the term “law” also began to designate the Jewish religious system<a href="#2" id="II">(2)</a> – whole or
                              in part – which by that time had developed into an elaborate combination of Biblical instructions and
                              rabbinical traditions. For the Jews, this use of the term “law” was natural; for to them Judaism was
                              the practical demonstration of God’s revealed will. New Testament references to works of the law
                              often indicated the ceremonial element,<a href="#3" id="III">(3)</a> as that was the most apparent feature of the Jewish
                              religious system.</p>
                        <p>So when using texts referring to “the law,” it is wise to carefully study the setting of the
                                    passage to determine in what sense the word “law” is being used. It is also helpful to be familiar with
                                    the major elements of the Old Testament legal system, and understand the distinguishing qualities
                                    of each.</p>

                        <h3>Three Types of Laws</h3>
                        <p>The Old Testament contains three basic types of laws – Moral, Ceremonial, and Civil. All
                              three were given under God’s direction.</p>
                        <h3>Moral Law</h3>
                        <p>The Moral Law is the basis of God’s universal kingdom. It is the expression of God’s
                              character. It exists because God exists, and as God is, so it is. The Moral Law combines a perfect
                              blend of justice and mercy. It may be summed up in one word: Love.</p>
                        <p>All the requirements of God’s Moral Law hang upon two great principles. The first is
                                    Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:5 - “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and
                                    with all thy might.” The second is Leviticus 19:18 - “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”</p>
                        <p>God created men with His law “written in their hearts.”<a href="#4" id="IV">(4)</a> But because they “did not like to
                              retain God in their knowledge,”<a href="#5" id="V">(5)</a> the law was, for the most part, forgotten. It was therefore
                              necessary for God to express His law in such a way that it would ever be remembered. With His own
                              mouth He spoke the Ten Commandments, and with His own finger, wrote them on two tables of
                              stone. The first four commandments, written on the first table, express one’s love for God. The last
                              six commandments, written on the second table, express one’s love for his neighbor.</p>
                        <p>To carefully guard the sacredness of the Ten Commandments, God gave Moses additional
                              precepts with minute instructions for everyday life. These “right judgments” and “good statutes”<a href="#6" id="VI">(6)</a>
                              were simply applications of the principles of the Ten Commandments, and as such are classed as
                              moral law.</p>
                        <p>The Moral Law defines righteousness, but has no power to redeem those who transgress it.
                              A remedial system was therefore necessary whereby God “might be just, and the justifier of him
                              which believeth.”<a href="#7" id="VII">(7)</a></p>
                        <h3>Ceremonial Law</h3>
                        <p>Ceremonial laws were those which regulated the services of the sanctuary, the offering of
                              sacrifices, and the priestly ministration. The Ceremonial Law is clearly distinguished from the Moral
                              Law.</p>
                        <p>Whereas the Moral Law defines the conduct of the righteous, the Ceremonial Law had to do
                              with the plan of salvation and God’s work of grace for the repentant, believing sinner. It was through
                              the Ceremonial Law that the righteousness of God was able to be “witnessed by the law and the
                              prophets.”<a href="#8" id="VIII">(8)</a></p>
                              <p>Every ordinance of the Ceremonial Law pointed to Christ and His work of saving man from
                                    sin. Every animal that was slain typified Christ’s death on the cross. Every function the priests
                                    performed symbolized Christ’s ministry in the Heavenly Sanctuary. Every sacred festival
                                    foreshadowed a saving event in the redemption of the world.</p>
                              <p>God never gave the Ceremonial Law as a covenant of works whereby one could earn God’s
                                    favor through meritorious acts. There was no saving value in the sacrificial activities themselves. But
                                    through those activities the believer could by faith<a href="#9" id="IX">(9)</a> claim the righteousness of Christ to atone for
                                    his sins. Thus the believer was continually to look forward to the “Lamb of God, which taketh away
                                    the sin of the world.”<a href="#10" id="X">(10)</a></p>
                        <h3>Civil Law</h3>
                        <p>Every country has civil regulations and the God-given authority for enforcing law and order.
                              So to Israel as a nation were given laws governing the administration of justice.<a href="#11" id="XI">(11)</a> These laws,
                              distinguished by their very nature, were of an inherently national type. Israel was subject to these
                              laws in the same way in which we are subject to the laws of the land in which we live. “Submit
                              yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake.” “Let every soul be subject unto the higher
                              powers. For...the powers that be are ordained of God.”<a href="#12" id="XII">(12)</a></p>
                        <p>Unlike the Ceremonial Laws, which were wholly symbolic in nature, the Civil Laws were not
                              abolished by the death of Christ. Rather, they lost their force when Israel ceased to be a nation. The
                              following chart contrasts the three types of Old Testament law.</p>

                        <h3>The Moral Law: The Historic Protestant Position</h3>
                        <p>The most widely accepted position on the Ten Commandments is reflected in the following
                              quotations from an introductory article in a popular Bible produced for Sears, Roebuck and Co.<a href="#13" id="XIII">(13)</a>
                              “The enduring stone on which it was written is a clear symbol that His law is permanent and
                              eternal....What Moses received was the Word of God, which had, and still has the force
                              of law....They have been written out so that they may ever be before us, and we may
                              become doers, as well as hearers of God’s law. (Rom.&nbsp;2:12&nbsp;-&nbsp;15)....It is through His love
                              for us that He has brought these rules together so that we may be better prepared to face
                              life.”</p>
                        <p>However, the idea has been promoted that God has withdrawn His great moral standard of
                              Ten Commandments, so that we are no longer under obligation to obey it. This teaching represents
                              a radical departure from the historic Protestant position. Never in the history of Christianity have
                              churchmen spoken so openly against God’s law as they do today.</p>
                        <p>Considering the admonition in Jude 3 to “earnestly contend for the faith which was once
                              delivered unto the saints,” let us review what our forefathers taught regarding the unchanging,
                              eternally-binding nature of the moral law of God. Here are a few quotations from various individuals
                              and groups.</p>
                        <h3>John Calvin:</h3>
                        <p>“We must not imagine that the coming of Christ has freed us from the authority of the law:
                              for it is the eternal rule of a devout and holy life, and must, therefore, be as
                              unchangeable, as the justice of God, which it embraced, is constant and uniform.”<a href="#14" id="XIV">(14)</a></p>
                        <p>“The law has sustained no dimunution of its authority, but ought always to receive from us
                              the same veneration and obedience.”<a href="#15" id="XV">(15)</a></p>
                        <h3>Martin Luther:</h3>
                        <p>“But how does it follow from this that on this account the law should be done away? Such
                              a conclusion I cannot find in my dialectics; besides, I should like to see and hear the
                              master who could prove it.</p>
                        <p>“...He was stricken for our sin – is the law thereby discarded?...Can anyone suppose that sin
                              exists where there is no law? Whoever puts away the law must also put away sin.”<a href="#16" id="XVI">(16)</a></p>
                        <h3>Samuel Mather:</h3>
                        <p>“The laws...delivered by Moses, were of three kinds – moral, ceremonial, and judicial.... The
                              first, or moral law, being the law of universal or unalterable right, is binding upon all
                              men, and is still in force.”<a href="#17" id="XVII">(17)</a></p>
                        <h3>Dwight L. Moody:</h3>
                        <p>“The commandments of God given to Moses in the mount at Horeb are as binding today as
                              ever they have been since the time when they were proclaimed in the hearing of the
                              people....The people must be made to understand that the ten commandments are still
                              binding, and that there is a penalty attached to their violation....Paul said: ‘Love is the
                              fulfilling of the law.’ But does this mean that the detailed precepts of the decalogue are
                              superseded, and have become back numbers? Does a father cease to give children rules
                              to obey because they love him? Does a nation burn its statute books because the people
                              have become patriotic? Not at all. And yet people speak as if the commandments do not

                              and reassert it....The Lord Jesus does not set up a milder law, nor will he allow any one
                              of his servants to presume to do so. Our King fulfils the ancient law, and his Spirit works
                              in us to will and to do of God’s good pleasure as set forth in the immutable statutes of

                        <h3>Being Under the Law</h3>
                        <p>Some who object to keeping the commandments cite Paul’s words in Romans&nbsp;6:14, “Ye are
                              not under the law, but under grace.” What did the apostle mean by that phrase?</p>
                        <p>It is clear from the rest of the book that Paul believed in the obligation of Christians to keep
                              the commandments (see Romans&nbsp;2:13;&nbsp;3:31;&nbsp;7:12; and&nbsp;8:4 for example). So what did he mean when
                              he said, “Ye are not under the law”?</p>
                        <p>If a person robs a bank, he is arrested, handcuffed, and taken to prison. He is locked behind
                              bars and cannot free himself. He is under the law. Then suppose he is pardoned and released from
                              jail. He is able to go home to his family. He is now under grace. Is he now at liberty to go back and
                              rob the bank again without punishment? Certainly not. In fact, because of the pardon he received,
                              he is under even greater obligation to keep the law than before.</p>
                        <p>To be “under the law” means to be under the condemnation of the law because of our
                              violation of it. Romans&nbsp;3:19 tells us that the sentence of the law against “them who are under the
                              law” is that they are “guilty before God.” Romans&nbsp;3 emphasizes that all the world is guilty and
                              therefore under the law, because all have sinned and transgressed that law. But Christ came “to
                              redeem them that were under the law” (Galatians&nbsp;4:5). He came to redeem us, not from the
                              obligation of the law, but “from the curse of the law” (Galatians&nbsp;3:13). Christ pays our penalty, He
                              pardons our transgression, and places us under grace.</p>
                        <p>The Bible says, “For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but
                              under grace” (Romans&nbsp;6:14). It is when we are under the dominion of sin that we are under the law.
                              In bondage to sin, we cannot free ourselves from its power. We have no means of escaping the curse
                              pronounced by the law upon us. But when we decide to commit ourselves to Christ, take up our cross
                              and follow Him as our Lord and Master, we are delivered from sin’s dominion. By His amazing
                              grace we are released from the chains which held us captive to sin. This is what the apostle meant
                              when he said, “Ye are not under the law, but under grace.” And it applies only to those who have
                              surrendered themselves to be “led of the Spirit” (Galatians&nbsp;5:18).</p>
                        <p>When Paul wanted to speak of people who recognized no obligation to obey God’s law, he
                              did not use the expression, “not under the law.” Instead, he used the expression, “without law.” And
                              he also made it clear that all such people will “perish without law.” Romans&nbsp;2:12.</p>
                        <p>The difference between “not under the law” and “without law” is emphasized in 1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:20-21. In verse 20 Paul uses the expression “under the law” in the same way he always
                              does. “Unto the Jews,” he says, “I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under
                              the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law.” Then he says, “To them that
                              are without law, as without law...” But at that point, to make it absolutely clear that he recognized
                              that as a servant of God he was under obligation to obey God’s law, he added in parentheses, “being
                              not without law to God, but under the law to Christ.”</p>
                        <p>So on the question of whether Christians are today under obligation to keep God’s law, Paul
                              made it very clear by stating:</p>
                        <p>“Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.” Romans&nbsp;3:31.</p>
                        <p>“Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth....Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good” Romans&nbsp;7:1,&nbsp;12.</p>
                        <h3>Being Delivered from the Law</h3>
                        <p>In Romans&nbsp;7:1&nbsp;-&nbsp;6 Paul tells the story of a woman who is “loosed from the law to her
                              husband.” He concludes his illustration by stating, “Now we are delivered from the law.” Some
                              people have used this story to say that Christians do not need to keep God’s law. But in fact, the
                              story teaches the exact opposite.</p>
                        <p>In the illustration, Paul explains that “the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law
                              to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her
                              husband. So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an
                              adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though
                              she be married to another man.”</p>
                        <p>“Wherefore,” Paul concludes, “ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that
                              ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth
                              fruit unto God.”</p>
                        <p>To keep us from misunderstanding his point, Paul prefaced the story by declaring that “the
                              law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth.” That is clear. Even in the illustration he affirms
                              that “if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress.”
                              These facts show that Paul considered the commandments to be still binding.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, notice that even the death of the husband does not change the law. Even after
                              the man dies, the law still says the same thing it always said about remarriage. The law has not
                              changed, only the woman’s relation to it. The woman is freed from the law, not because of any
                              annulling of the law, but because there is no law against remarriage after a spouse’s death.</p>
                        <p>So it is with the one who has the power of Christ in his life. He is delivered from the law
                              because he no longer violates the law. The law has not changed. It still requires just what it always
                              did. But the Christian has changed. His life now exhibits the fruit of the Spirit:</p>
                        <p>“Love, joy, peace...against such there is no law.” Galatians&nbsp;5:22&nbsp;-&nbsp;23.</p>
                        <p>The problem of being “in the flesh” (Romans&nbsp;7:5) lies in “the motions of sins” which are
                              defined by the law. The problem is not the law, but sin (verses 7-13). Here is the point. We are
                              “delivered from the law” when we become “dead to that wherein we were held” (verse 6, margin).
                              Since it was sin which held us, only death to sin (Romans&nbsp;6:2) can deliver us from the law. By
                              experiencing such death to sin we are enabled to serve the law “in newness of the spirit” (Romans&nbsp;7:6).</p>
