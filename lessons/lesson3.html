                          <h4>Jerusalem</h4>
                          <p>In less than forty years from the giving of that warning, Jerusalem fell to the armies of Rome. And just as He had predicted, not one stone of the magnificent temple was left upon another that was not thrown down.</p>
                    </details>
              
              <h3>4. What sign would let Christ’s followers know that the desolation of the city was nigh? Luke&nbsp;21:20</h3>

                          <h4>Jerusalem compassed with armies</h4>
                          <p>In October, A.D. 66, Cestius besieged Jerusalem. The Christians in the city recognized this as the sign given by Christ. When the Romans suddenly withdrew, the Christians fled, not one losing his life. Soon Roman armies led by Titus returned, and in A.D. 70, the city was destroyed. More than a million Jews perished.</p>

                          <h4>Great tribulation</h4>
                          <p>For the next nearly 250 years the church suffered intense persecution from the Roman government. Christians were given to wild beasts, or smeared with pitch and lashed to poles to serve as torches for the arena. Three million were martyred for their faith in Christ.</p>
                          <p>Then Constantine, realizing that Christianity could not be stamped out, staged a political conversion, and proclaimed Christianity (well mingled with paganism) to be the official religion of the empire. But the long centuries of enforced religion that followed produced even more severe religious intolerance which took the lives of more than 50 million people. Not until the opening up of the American continent were Christians finally permitted full liberty of conscience without threat of persecution.</p>

              <h3>6. What specific signs did Jesus say would be given immediately after the tribulation of those days? Matthew&nbsp;24:29</h3>
                  <h4>The sun would</h4><textarea></textarea>

                          <h4>The sun would: Be darkened;</h4> 
                        <h4>The moon would: Not give her light</h4>
                              <h4>The stars would: Fall from heaven</h4>
                          <p>With the establishment of the United States of America, the centuries of religious persecution came to an end. The Declaration of Independence, perhaps the most famous freedom document of all time, was signed in 1776, stating that “all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” America opened her doors to all who sought religious freedom, guaranteeing the right of all to worship according to their own conscience.</p>
                          <p>Jesus said, “Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened . . . .” The United States had barely been born when on May 19, 1780 it witnessed what has been remembered in history as the great Dark Day. According to the Boston Gazette, “there was the appearance of midnight at noonday.” The darkness began around 10 a.m. Candles were lighted; animals thought it was night. The Connecticut Historical Collections describes the tension in the state legislature where, “a very general opinion prevailed, that the day of judgment was at hand.” The poet John Greenleaf Whittier called it “a horror of great darkness.”</p>
                          <p>Jesus went on to say, “. . . And the moon shall not give her light.” The Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, referring to the Dark Day, contains this record: “The darkness of the following evening was probably as gross as ever has been observed. . . . If every luminous body in the universe had been shrouded in impenetrable shades, or struck out of existence, the darkness could not have been more complete. A sheet of white paper held within a few inches of the eyes was equally invisible with the blackest velvet. . . . This gross darkness held ‘till about one o’clock, although the moon had fulled but the day before.”</p>
                          <p>The third sign Jesus mentioned was “. . . The stars shall fall from heaven.” On November 13, 1833, from 2 a.m. until daylight, the sky all over North America was aflame with meteors. One observer remarked, “It seemed as if the whole starry heavens had congregated at one point near the zenith, and were simultaneously shooting forth, with the velocity of lightning, to every part of the horizon; and yet they were not exhausted.” Astronomer W. J. Fisher, in The Telescope, called it “the most magnificent meteor shower on record.”</p>

                          <h4>A great earthquake</h4>
                          <p>One of the most extensively felt earthquakes ever recorded occurred November 1, 1755. Extending over an area of at least four million square miles, it covered the greater part of Europe, Africa, and America. Seventy thousand people were killed. In Lisbon, Portugal violent shaking lasted for at least six minutes, destroying most of the city. The sea rose fifty feet above its ordinary level.  Encyclopaedia Britannica called it “the most famous of all earthquakes.” G. A. Eiby, in About Earthquakes, referred to it as “the greatest earthquake on record.”</p>

                  <h2>Supplement to Lesson 3</h2>
                  <p>In the seven seals of Revelation, as in the seven churches and seven trumpets, John was shown a delineation of conditions which would characterize the successive stages of the Christian era. By studying the outline given in these prophecies, we are able to see where we stand in the stream of time.</p>
                  <p>As the first seal is opened (Revelation 6:1, 2), a white horse appears, “and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.” This is a description of the advance of the gospel in the first century. Through the missionary zeal of the early church the gospel “was preached to every creature which is under heaven” (Colossians 1:23). The white horse indicates the church in its original purity. The crown, or victory wreath, shows its conquest over the power of the enemy through the direction and leadership of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The second seal (Revelation 6:3, 4) reveals a red horse. In this bloody scene, peace is taken from the earth, and many are killed with a great sword. From the beginning of the second century until Constantine’s edict of A.D. 313, Christianity was illegal throughout the pagan Roman empire, and Christians were terribly persecuted.</p>
                  <p>The opening of the third seal (Revelation 6:5, 6) provides us a view of Christianity’s status for
                        the 200 years following A.D. 313. The horse, now black, reveals that the church had lost its original
                        purity. Its rider holds a pair of balances. A voice is heard declaring that the amount of money which
                        previously was equivalent to a full day’s wage (Matthew 20:2), is now only worth a quart of wheat.
                        What an appropriate illustration of how, through Constantine’s efforts to blend it with paganism,
                        Christianity had been cheapened. Previously, to declare yourself a “Christian” might cost you your life.
                        Now the word had so lost its value that every vile pagan walking the street was a member of the church.</p>
                  <p>The opening of the fourth seal (Revelation 6:7, 8) ushers in a pale horse. Here is a church that
                        is lifeless and pale, its religion a mixture of truth and error. Its rider is Death, and the Grave follows
                        closely behind. This represents the period of the Dark Ages during which the spark of true godliness was
                        almost entirely extinguished by the high hand of church representatives. “And Power was given unto
                        them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the
                        beasts of the earth.” The tribulation of those days was so terrible that Jesus said, “Except those days
                        should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved” (Matthew 24:22).</p>
                  <p>When the fifth seal is opened (Revelation 6:9-11), the figure changes. The cumulative deaths
                        of millions of God’s people through centuries of oppression are now pictured as crying out to God,
                        calling for justice. “How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them
                        that dwell on the earth?” The answer is given that the dead must “rest yet for a little season.”</p>
                  <p>The first five seals have brought us down from the first century to the mid 1700’s. We now turn
                        our attention to the signs of the end which would then appear under the opening of the sixth seal
                        (Revelation 6:12, 13).</p>
                  <h3>Sign #1: November 1, 1755, “Lo, there was a great earthquake.”</h3>
                  <p>“Probably the most famous of all earthquakes is that which destroyed Lisbon on Nov. 1, 1755.
                        There were three great earthquakes (the first was the largest) at 9:40 A.M., 10 A.M. and at noon. The
                        main shock lasted six to seven minutes, an unusually long duration. Within six minutes at least 30,000
                        people were killed, all large public buildings and 12,000 dwellings were demolished. It was a church
                        day, and great loss of life occurred in the churches. A fire followed which burned for six days. A marble
                        quay at the riverside disappeared into the river bottom laden with people. Alexander von Humboldt
                        stated that the total area shaken was four times that of Europe.” Encyclopedia Britannica Vol. 7, p 848
                        (1961 ed.).</p>
                  <p>“By far the most spectacular earthquake of earlier times was that of Lisbon, in 1755. This has
                        some claim to be regarded as the greatest earthquake on record. If it is possible to believe reports, the
                        felt area, which was certainly more than 700 miles in radius, extended from the Azores to Italy, and from
                        England to North Africa. A source of confusion in the reports of this shock, which makes it difficult to
                        judge the real extent of the felt area, was the widespread occurrence of seiches,...wave movements in
                        ponds and lakes....</p>
                  <p>“Oscillations of this kind were observed in France, Italy, Holland, Switzerland, and England, and
                        reports of the movements even came from Norway and Sweden, at a distance of nearly 1800 miles from
                        the epicentre. In those countries, however, the shock was certainly not felt....</p>
                  <p>“In 1755, the damage to Lisbon itself was very great. At that time, the city had about 230,000
                        inhabitants, nearly 30,000 of whom were killed, according to conservative estimates. Great numbers of
                        people were in the churches, for it was All Saints’ Day, and the time of the first Mass. The shock was
                        followed by a tsunami (tidal wave:) about twenty feet in height, and by fire.</p>
                  <p>“The disaster shocked all Europe, and the moralists and the wiseacres were not slow to make
                        capital of it.” About Earthquakes, p 141-142, by G.A. Eiby (New York: Harper, 1957).</p>
                  <h3>Sign #2: May 19, 1780, “And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair.”</h3>
                  <p>“About eleven o’clock the darkness was such as to demand our attention, and put us upon making
                  observations. At half past eleven, in a room with three windows, 24 panes each, all open towards the
                  south-east and south, large print could not be read by persons of good eyes. About twelve o’clock the
                  windows being still open, a candle cast a shade so well defined on the wall, as that profiles were taken
                  with as much ease as they could have been in the night. About one o’clock a glin of light which had
                  continued ‘till this time in the east, shut in, and the darkness was greater than it had been for any time
                  before, Between one and two o’clock, the wind from the west freshened a little, and a glin appeared in
                  that quarter. We dined about two the windows all open, and two candles burning on the table. In the time
                  of the greatest darkness some of the dunghill fowls went to their roost: Cocks crowed in answer to one
                  another as they commonly do in the night: Woodcocks, which are night birds, whistled as they do only
                  in the dark: Frogs peeped In short, there was the appearance of midnight at noonday.” <em>The Boston
                  Gazette and the Country Journal, May 29, 1780, p 4.</em></p>
                  <p>“People were unable to read common print determine the time of day by their clocks or watches
                        dine or manage their domestic business, without the light of candles. In some places, the darkness was
                        so great, that persons could not see to read common print in the open air, for several hours together.”

                  <p>“The 19th of May, 1780, was a remarkable dark day. Candles were lighted in many houses; the
                        birds were silent and disappeared, and the fouls retired to roost. The legislature of Connecticut was then
                        in session at Hartford. A very general opinion prevailed, that the day of judgment was at hand. The
                        House of Representatives, being unable to transact their business, adjourned. A proposal to adjourn the
                        council was under consideration. When the opinion of Colonel [Abraham] Davenport was asked, he
                        answered, ‘I am against an adjournment. The day of judgment is either approaching, or it is not. If it is
                        not, there is no cause for an adjournment: if it is, I choose to be found doing my duty. I wish therefore
                        that candles may be brought.’” <em>Timothy Dwight, quoted in Connecticut Historical Collections, compiled
                        by John Warner Barber, p 403 (2d ed.; New Haven: Durrie & Peck and J. W. Barber, 1836).</em></p>
                  <p>“Twas on a May-day of the far old year Seventeen hundred eighty, that there fell Over the bloom
                        and sweet life of the Spring, Over the fresh earth and the heaven of noon, A horror of great darkness.</p>
                  <p>“Men prayed, and women wept; all ears grew sharp To hear the doom-blast of the trumpet shatter
                        The black sky, that the dreadful face of Christ Might look from the rent clouds, not as he looked A
                        loving guest at Bethany, but stern As Justice and inexorable Law.</p>
                  <p>“Meanwhile in the old State House, dim as ghosts, Sat the lawgivers of Connecticut, Trembling
                        beneath their legislative robes. ‘It is the Lord’s Great Day! Let us adjourn,’ Some said; and then, as if
                        with one accord, All eyes were turned to Abraham Davenport. He rose, slow cleaving with his steady
                        voice The intolerable hush. ‘This well may be The Day of Judgment which the world awaits; But be it
                        so or not, I only know My present duty, and my Lord’s command To occupy till He come. So at the post
                        Where He hath set me in His providence, I choose, for one, to meet Him face to face, No faithless
                        servant frightened from my task, But ready when the Lord of the harvest calls; And therefore, with all
                        reverence, I would say, Let God do His work, we will see to ours. Bring in the candles.’” <em>“Abraham

                  <p>“Perhaps some, by assigning a natural cause of this, ascribing it to the thick vapor in the air, will endeavor to evade the force of its being a sign, but, the same objection will lie against earthquakes being signs which our Lord expressly mentions as such. For my part, I really consider the darkness as one of the prodigies foretold in the text; designed for our admonition, and warning.” <em>Discourse by eyewitness Elam Potter, delivered May 28, 1780, in Enfield Conn., quoted in The Advent Herald, March 13, 1844, p 46.</em></p>
                  <p>[Note: Any suggestion of a natural cause can in no wise militate against the significance of the event as
                        a prophetic fulfillment. The time-honored explanation is that seventeen and a half centuries before it
                        occurred, the Saviour had definitely foretold this twofold sign saying, “In those days, after that
                        tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light” (Mark 13:24); and these
                        signs occurred exactly as predicted and at the time indicated so long before their occurrence. It has long
                        been pointed out that it is the fact, and not the cause, of the darkness that is significant in this connection;
                        as also in the case of earthquakes, falling stars, and other events seen as signs of the times. When the
                        Lord would open a path for his people through the sea, he did it by “a strong east wind.” Ex. 14:21. Was
                        it for this reason any less miraculous? In like manner, to account for the remarkable darkening of the sun
                        and moon or of the falling of the stars as events in nature is not to discredit them as merciful signs of the
                        approaching end of probationary time.]</p>

                  <p>“The second is that of the moon’s turning to blood; this I have not seen, but, from information,
                        I have reason to believe it did take place between 2 o’clock and day break in the morning of the same
                        night after which the sun was darkened, which was said to appear as a clotter of blood; and it is the more
                        probable, as that night, before the moon appeared, was as dark, in proportion, as the day, and of course
                        would give the moon an extraordinary appearance-not suffering her to give her light.” <em>A View of

                  <p>“The morning of November 13th, 1833, was rendered memorable by an exhibition of the
                  phenomenon called SHOOTING STARS, which was probably more extensive and magnificent than any
                  similar one hitherto recorded....</p>
                  <p>“Probably no celestial phenomenon has ever occurred in this country, since its first settlement,
                        which was viewed with so much admiration and delight by one class of spectators, or with so much
                        astonishment and fear by another class....</p>
                  <p>“The reader may imagine a constant succession of fire balls, resembling sky rockets, radiating
                        in all directions from a point in the heavens, a few degrees south-east of the zenith, and following the
                        arch of the sky towards the horizon....The balls, as they travelled down the vault, usually left after them
                        a vivid streak of light, and just before they disappeared, exploded, or suddenly resolved themselves into
                        smoke. No report or noise of any kind was observed, although we listened attentively....</p>
                  <p>“The flashes of light, although less intense than lightning, were so bright as to awaken people
                        in their beds. One ball that shot off in the north-west direction, and exploded a little northward of the
                        star Capella, left, just behind the place of explosion, a phosphorescent train of peculiar beauty....</p>
                  <p>“The meteors began to attract notice by their unusual frequency or brilliancy, from nine to twelve
                        o’clock in the evening, were most striking in their appearance, from two to five, arrived at their
                        maximum, in many places, about four o’clock, and continued till rendered invisible by the light of day.”
