                        <p>The first chapter of Acts describes how Jesus went back to heaven.  Notice the emphasis on the fact that the disciples actually watched Him go up:</p>
                        <p>“while they beheld” (verse 9) “their sight” (verse 9) “while they looked” (verse 10)</p>

Mat 28:2 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. 3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: 4 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.

                        <p>The coming of Jesus with all His angels will be literally earthshattering. Notice Revelation’s description:</p>
                        <p>“And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?” Revelation&nbsp;6:14&nbsp;-&nbsp;17.</p>
                        <p>“And there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. . . . And the cities of the nations fell. . . . And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent.” Revelation&nbsp;16:18&nbsp;-&nbsp;20.</p>
